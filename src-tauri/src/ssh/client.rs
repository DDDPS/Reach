/// POSIX color/prompt initialization injected after login. Safe for bash, zsh,

/// without a colored prompt, a sensible `PS1`. A blank prompt while it runs and
/// a clear at the end are what hide it.
/// NOTE: this is bash/POSIX syntax — it is NOT valid in fish, which is why the
/// init is selected per shell family (see `shell_init`).
///
/// Hardened for cross-platform edge cases:
/// - `dircolors` is guarded with `command -v` (absent on macOS/BSD).
/// - `ls` color flag is detected: GNU `--color=auto` vs BSD `-G`, so the alias
///   doesn't break `ls` on macOS/BSD where `--color` is an unknown option.
/// - `alias` calls are wrapped in `{ …; } 2>/dev/null`, because a strict POSIX
///   shell without the builtin (posh) prints `alias: not found` from the SHELL,
///   which a redirection on the command itself does not catch.
/// - `clear` is tolerated-if-missing, and backed by a raw escape sequence.
///
/// 🔴 NO `stty` HERE. It was the obvious way to hide the init, it was in this
/// code, and it drops input. `stty` applies the new termios with a flush, which
/// discards whatever is still sitting unread in the tty input queue — that is,
/// the init lines written behind it in the same burst. Measured with one
/// `stty -echo` followed by twenty `echo` lines in a single write, five runs
/// each, on a real PTY:
///
///     ksh93   12/20 survived, the SAME first 8 lines lost every run
///     BusyBox ash, dash, bash, zsh, mksh, posh   20/20
///     every one of the seven   20/20 with no stty at all
///
/// Only ksh93 loses lines here, but it loses them silently and reproducibly,
/// and a shell that swallows the middle of its own init is the exact failure
/// class of issue #47. The prompt is blanked for the duration instead: it costs
/// nothing, hides just as much, and cannot discard input on any shell.
///
/// 🔴 ONE COMPLETE COMMAND PER LINE, AND EVERY LINE SHORT. This used to be a
/// single 606-byte line, which hung the shell on OpenWrt (issue #47 follow-up).
/// BusyBox's line editor keeps the input line in an on-stack buffer capped at
/// `CONFIG_FEATURE_EDITING_MAX_LEN`, and silently drops every character past it
/// — `libbb/lineedit.c` breaks out of the insert with no beep and no error:
///
///     if ((int)command_len >= (maxsize - 2)) { /* no space for char and EOL */ break; }
///
/// OpenWrt ships that cap at 512 (its own ticket #18844 is titled "/bin/sh in
/// some cases needed command prompt more than 512 bytes"), so 510 bytes of the
/// 606 arrived, the cut landed inside `PS1="…`, and the surviving text carried
/// an unterminated double quote. ash then sat at its `>` continuation prompt
/// waiting for a quote that was never coming, and the session was dead on
/// arrival. It applies to interactive sessions, which is exactly a PTY shell.
///
/// So: each line below is a COMPLETE command, quote-balanced, and under 96
/// bytes — comfortably inside the 126 usable bytes of the smallest cap BusyBox
/// can even be configured to (`range 128 8192`). A device cannot truncate us
/// into a hang no matter how it was built. `posix_init_lines_are_short` pins
/// it. Do not merge these back onto one line to make it tidy.
