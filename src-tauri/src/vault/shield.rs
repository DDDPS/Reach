//! Keys kept encrypted in memory, and never swapped to disk.
//!
//! The vault's long-lived keys (the key that unlocks the vault, each vault's
//! master key, the identity key) are in memory for as long as the vault is
//! unlocked. Held as plain bytes, any read of this process's memory, a dump,
//! a scraper or a side channel such as Spectre or Rowhammer, would hand them
//! over whole.
//!
//! So they are held encrypted, the way OpenSSH shields private keys since
//! 8.1 and Sequoia PGP's `mem::Encrypted` does after it. Once per process a
//! 16 KiB random prekey is made. Each secret gets its own random salt, is
//! sealed with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under SHA-512(salt ‖ prekey), and is opened
//! only for the length of a call ([`Shielded::with`]), into a buffer that is
//! wiped as the call returns. To read a key an attacker needs all 16 KiB of
//! the prekey without a single wrong bit, which is what makes partial and
//! noisy reads useless.
//!
//! The prekey and every opened buffer are locked into RAM (`memsec::mlock`:
//! `VirtualLock` on Windows, `mlock` elsewhere, and on Linux left out of core
//! dumps), so neither reaches the swap file. Locking is best-effort: a system
//! that refuses it (Linux caps how much a process may lock) is logged once,
//! and the keys stay encrypted regardless.
